                <h2>Saqalaksar Lake</h2>
                <p> Saqalaksar lake plus all the surrounding luscious green forests are about sixty-four meters above the sea level and cover a fifteen hectares area. The lake is six hundred meters long and five hundred meters wide. Saqalaksar lake is an artificial one, shaping behind a dam. Therefore it is supplied by the precipitation and the springs around the area.

                <p id="content-continue">
                    Literally, Saqalaksar is a combination of three words, “saqa”, meaning waterhole, “lak” meaning stork, and “sar” meaning starling; so it means where lak and sar provide their water from. They say these birds live around and use the lake as their water supply.
                    <br>To grasp all the beauty and to take a sip of the tranquility make sure you walk along the coast of the lake and through the woods. And listen to the birds, sing. If you’d rather camp there and enjoy the quiet peace of the lake, try to visit during the weekdays, not on weekends or holidays because it gets crowded.
                    There are some boats to pedal through the lake and take a look around with a much different perspective.
